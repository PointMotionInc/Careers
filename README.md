## Developer Hiring - Process

If you got link to this README file from a recruiter or through a personal message, you already went through the first round of filtering. It seems like a fit! If you landed here through some other way and looking for an opportunity, follow the next steps anyway. 

Not everyone takes action, you will be ahead of most others just by taking action.

Here are the next steps:

1. Pick up one of the tasks below and build it using Javascript (You can use any framework)
2. Once you've completed the task, you will have to deploy your code and submit the live URL + Code through an API. We don't have a UI for this yet (Hey! we're hiring people for frontend!)
3. You receive a confirmation email with someone from our team in CC (API does that automatically).
4. Best case: You get selected and join our team. Worst case, you improve your skills and add a new project to your work-ex. Win-Win. Your code will always be your IP and won't be used anywhere in our product.



## Step 1: Choose a challenge

Even though we do not hire people as "frontend" or "backend", we understand that you may want to grow one "end" at a time. So, you have three options as a challenge.



### Backend Challenge

If you find databases, cloud servers, APIs, scaling most exciting. Take up this challenge.


### Frontend (Logic) Challenge

If you like frontend more, then pick up this challenge.

## Frontend (UI) Challenge

If you're into pixel perfect designs. This is your challenge.


Once you're done, send your task to aman@pointmotioncontrol.com
